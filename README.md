XcodeCodeSnippets
=================

A Collection of Code Snippets I use in Xcode 5


Instructions:
1- Delete existing Code Snippets Folder in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData  **Warning: If you created custom Code Snippets you may want to save that folder and add it back once repo has been cloned. Also send us your snippets in order to have a good collection of Code Snippets.
2- If you cloned the repo folder into your ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData folder then anytime there are new snippets a simple pull will update the snippets.

Side note: when you update Xcode most likely the directory will be cleaned out again so you might want to repeat the steps if you no longer see the snippets in Xcode.
