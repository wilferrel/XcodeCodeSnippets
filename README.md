XcodeCodeSnippets
=================

A Collection of Code Snippets I use in Xcode 6


###Instructions:
1. Delete existing Code Snippets Folder in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets  **Warning:** If you created custom Code Snippets you may want to save that folder and add it back once repo has been cloned. Also send us your snippets in order to have a good collection of Code Snippets.


**Xcode6** :/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Frameworks/IDEKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets


2. If you cloned the repo folder into your ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets folder then anytime there are new snippets a simple pull will update the snippets.

**Side note:** when you update Xcode most likely the directory will be cleaned out again so you might want to repeat the steps if you no longer see the snippets in Xcode.
